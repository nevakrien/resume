# Ai research and Education
been a mentee of Guy Tamir (Email: guy.tamir@intel.com) and worked with Intel.
since 2022. 

my work includes but isnt limited to:

1. been on a research team that worked on [AI research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308) 
my focus was evaluation code but I also helped the dev team debug.
2. My code has been used as an example in Intelâ€™s official [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ToSvHidy0&list=PLXB3P9W0qDDhtDAjs1U2arVWiyq9z3nDS&index=5)

# Side Projects
**GitHub Profile**: [Neva Krien's GitHub](https://github.com/nevakrien)

- **Website** made a small [AI assistant website](https://github.com/nevakrien/ai_secretary2)
using the openai API with a bit of custom prompt engineering logic.

- **Compilers**
made 2 different compilers/languges 1 using just pure c99+Nasm and another with unsafe Rust

- **VPN proxy**
made a small [vpn proxy](https://github.com/nevakrien/vpn_proxy) that allows managing VPN ips.

- **Accidental Rebuild of pypi-timemachine**

- **Movie Subtitles Translation Tool**: Used by my mentor
- [**Auto_New**](https://crates.io/crates/auto_new) Rust libarary for optimizing constructors(over 100 downloads in the first 2 days)
- **CUDA Matrix Multiplication**: Including optimizations
- **Profiler for C++ LLM Code**
- **Genetic Algorithm Runtime**
