- **Website** made a small [AI assistant website](https://github.com/nevakrien/ai_secretary2)
using the openai API with a bit of custom prompt engineering logic.

- **Compilers**
made 2 diffrent compilers/languges 1 using just pure c99 and another with unsafe Rust that was more generaly purpose.

- **VPN proxy**
made a small [vpn proxy](https://github.com/nevakrien/vpn_proxy) that allows managing VPN ips.
