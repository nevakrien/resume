## **Professional Experience**  

## **AI Developer**  
**Dates**: 2022 – Present  

- **Educational Content Creation**: *Intel*  
  Since 2022, I have developed educational content explaining AI development concepts and technologies.  
  My work includes writing code featured in Intel’s official [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ToSvHidy0&list=PLXB3P9W0qDDhtDAjs1U2arVWiyq9z3nDS&index=5) and internal workshops.  
  I specialize in breaking down complex AI topics and new research into digestible formats for both technical and non-technical audiences.  
  Additionally, I wrote inference code optimized for consumer laptops, achieving up to **10x reliability improvements** through OpenVINO optimizations.

- **Research Contributions**: *Intel and Technion Collaboration*  
  As part of a collaborative team between Intel and Technion, I worked on developing code generation LLMs for C, C++, and Fortran.  
  Initially recruited for my mathematical expertise, I expanded my responsibilities to include implementing and debugging robust LLM evaluation pipelines and optimizing model performance for Intel GPUs.  
  **Publication**: [Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09440)

## **Projects**  
- **Compiler Development**:  
  Developed two compilers using C99, C++-17, and unsafe Rust ([Faeyne_lang](https://github.com/nevakrien/Faeyne_lang), [Turing Compiler](https://github.com/nevakrien/Turing-compiler)).  
  Tail call optimization, constant folding, memory alignment, and a bytecode virtual machine were implemented.  
  Achieved over 2x performance improvement from the baseline.

- **AI Assistant Website**:  
  Built an AI assistant using OpenAI API with custom prompt engineering logic ([GitHub](https://github.com/nevakrien/ai_secretary2)).  
  Designed the architecture for efficient API interactions and custom workflows.

- **Movie Subtitle Translation Tool**:  
  Created a tool that automates subtitle translations ([GitHub](https://github.com/nevakrien/srt_translate)).  
  Saved an estimated 20 hours of manual translation work for 1 hour of development time.

- **VPN Proxy**:  
  Created a tool to manage VPN proxying for web scraping tasks ([GitHub](https://github.com/nevakrien/vpn_proxy)), allowing the use of six rotating addresses instead of one.
