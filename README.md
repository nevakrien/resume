# Neva Krien
Low-level systems programmer with research experience in LLMs.

## AI Research & Education

- Mentee of Guy Tamir (Intel) since 2022; contributed to research and educational outreach in AI.
- Participated in a research team focused on large language models (LLMs) for C++ code generation.  
  *(Reference: [our first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09440))*
- Built demo applications for Intel products, including presenting at an in-person Intel AI-PC workshop.
- Authored example code used in Intelâ€™s official [YouTube AI tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ToSvHidy0&list=PLXB3P9W0qDDhtDAjs1U2arVWiyq9z3nDS&index=5).

## Language Design & Compiler Work

- Core team member of [PAL](https://social.programming-language.design/t/radical-determinism/25): A new programming language currently under closed development.
- Built two toy compilers/interpreters:
  - One in **pure C99 + NASM**, including a full optimization pipeline (constant folding, loop unrolling, branch elimination).
  - One in **Rust**, using `unsafe` for a simple dynamic language with a VM.

## Open Source & Community Contributions

- Contributor to [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl): Working on a [PR](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/17152) for a 5-year-old issue, in collaboration with maintainers.

## My Own Tools

- [`source_viewer`](https://crates.io/crates/source_viewer): A language-agnostic Rust CLI tool for analyzing disassembly. Supports any language without requiring a special build.
- [`auto_new`](https://crates.io/crates/auto_new): A procedural macro for ergonomic constructor generation in Rust (100+ downloads in the first 2 days). Lightweight, fast, and dependency-free.

## Educational Content

- [Blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@nevo.krien): Writings on systems programming.
- [`benchmark-errors`](https://github.com/nevakrien/benchmark-errors): Educational repo with curated examples of common benchmarking pitfalls and statistical analysis.

## Side Projects

- **Movie Subtitles Translation Tool**: Used by my mentor; converts and batch-translates subtitle files via [CLI pipeline](https://github.com/nevakrien/srt_translate).
- **Accidental Rebuild of pypi-timemachine**: Recreated functionality for [reproducible PyPI builds](https://github.com/nevakrien/time_machine_pip).
- [`vpn_proxy`](https://github.com/nevakrien/vpn_proxy): Simple tool for managing VPN exit IPs; made as a weekend learning project.
- [AI Assistant Website](https://github.com/nevakrien/ai_secretary2): Small website using OpenAI API for scheduling; includes custom prompt logic and basic UI.

- ...and more.
