# Ai research and Education
been a mentee of Guy Tamir (Email: guy.tamir@intel.com) and worked with Intel.
since 2022. 

my work includes but isnt limited to:

1. been on a research team that worked on [AI research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308) 
my focus was evaluation code but I also helped the dev team debug.
2. Working on demos for intel products: including an in person workshop for intels AI-PC.
3. My code has been used as an example in Intelâ€™s official [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ToSvHidy0&list=PLXB3P9W0qDDhtDAjs1U2arVWiyq9z3nDS&index=5)

# Side Projects
**GitHub Profile**: [Neva Krien's GitHub](https://github.com/nevakrien)

- **Compilers**
made 2 different compilers/languges 1 using just pure c99+Nasm and another with unsafe Rust

- **VPN proxy**
made a small [vpn proxy](https://github.com/nevakrien/vpn_proxy) that allows managing VPN ips.

- **Website** made a small [AI assistant website](https://github.com/nevakrien/ai_secretary2)
using the openai API with a bit of custom prompt engineering logic.
