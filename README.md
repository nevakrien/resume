## Academic Research
I have been on a team developing new code generation LLMs for C, C++, and Fortran. Originally brought on because I had a strong grasp of the math (followed the research on and off since 2016). Later picked up implementation as well, including working with Intel GPUs.

The team was a collaboration between Intel and Technion. I was there as an independent researcher.

**Publication**: [Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09440)

## Toy Compiler
**Project**: Optimizing Compiler For Turing Machines
- **Languages**: C, C++, and x86-64 Assembly

Utilizes raw NASM assembly for most parts, with statically linked precompiled C for IO.

**Key Optimizations**:

  1. Dead code elimination
  2. Constant folding
  3. Memory alignment
