## Academic Research
**Languages**: Python

I have been part of a team developing new code generation LLMs for C, C++, and Fortran. Initially brought on for my strong grasp of mathematics (having followed the research on and off since 2016), I later expanded my role to include implementation, including work with Intel GPUs.

This project was a collaboration between Intel and Technion, where I contributed as an independent researcher.

**Publication**: [Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09440)

## Programming Language
**Languages**: Rust

**Project**: Managed Memory Interpreter for a Simple Scripting Language  

This project was optimized by reviewing raw assembly output and incorporating some unsafe Rust for specific features. The language was initially implemented with a tree-walk interpreter and later transitioned to a bytecode .

**Key Features**:
1. Tail call optimization
2. Lambda functions
3. File operations

**Code**: [Faeyne_lang GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nevakrien/Faeyne_lang)

## AI Education
**Languages**: Python

Since 2022,  I have been a mentee of Guy Tamir. We worked on many things but mainly on educational content explaining AI development. My code has been used as an example in Intelâ€™s official [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ToSvHidy0&list=PLXB3P9W0qDDhtDAjs1U2arVWiyq9z3nDS&index=5) and in internal workshops.

In addition to writing code, I have contributed by explaining specific AI technologies and summarizing literature, similar to my work in my research position.

## Toy Compiler
**Languages**: C, C++, and x86-64 Assembly  

**Project**: Optimizing Compiler for Turing Machines  

Utilizes raw NASM assembly for core components, with statically linked precompiled C for I/O. This project has no external dependencies or packages.

**Key Optimizations**:
1. Dead code elimination
2. Constant folding
3. Memory alignment

**Articles**: [Compiler from Scratch](https://medium.com/@nevo.krien/list/compiler-from-scratch-eaaf449bb894)
